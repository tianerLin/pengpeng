Developerâ€™s Message:
Looking back, I was once passionate about finding traces of myself or things related to me on 3D maps. As the years go by, childhood dreams gradually fade away. Now, through this platform, I hope to rekindle the joy of childhood together with you. By clicking on a location on the map, you can mark it, record the events happening here at this moment, and upload photos as mementos. Years from now, let us revisit these cherished memories together and remember every footprint left by time.
