Developer’s Message:
Looking back, I was once passionate about finding traces of myself or things related to me on 3D maps. As the years go by, childhood dreams gradually fade away. Now, through this platform, I hope to rekindle the joy of childhood together with you. By clicking on a location on the map, you can mark it, record the events happening here at this moment, and upload photos as mementos. Years from now, let us revisit these cherished memories together and remember every footprint left by time.

开发者寄语：
回首往昔，我曾热衷于在3D地图上寻找自己或与自己有关事物的足迹。随着年龄的增长，童年的梦想逐渐淡去。如今，我希望借助这个平台，与大家一同重拾儿时的乐趣。您可以通过点击地图上的地点进行标记，记录此刻在这里发生的事件，并上传图片加以留念。多年以后，让我们一同回顾这些珍贵的点滴，铭记每一处时光留下的痕迹。
